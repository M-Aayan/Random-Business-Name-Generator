## üìå About

The **Random Business Name Generator** is a beginner-friendly project that demonstrates how to use JavaScript's `Math.random()` function along with conditional logic to produce different combinations of business names. Every time you run the program, it greets you with an alert and then generates a new business name like:

> üîπ Crazy Foods Bros  
> üîπ Amazing Engine Hub  
> üîπ Fire Sports Limited  
> ...and many more!

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. When the script runs, it shows a welcome message using `alert()`.
2. It randomly picks:
   - A first word from: `Crazy`, `Amazing`, `Fire`
   - A second word from: `Engine`, `Foods`, `Sports`
   - A third word from: `Limited`, `Hub`, `Bros`
3. These words are concatenated to form a unique business name.
4. The final name is shown in an alert popup.
